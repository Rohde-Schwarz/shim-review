This repo is for review of requests for signing shim.  To create a request for review:

- clone this repo
- edit the template below
- add the shim.efi to be signed
- add build logs
- add any additional binaries/certificates/SHA256 hashes that may be needed
- commit all of that
- tag it with a tag of the form "myorg-shim-arch-YYYYMMDD"
- push that to github
- file an issue at https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues with a link to your branch
- approval is ready when you have accepted tag

Note that we really only have experience with using GRUB2 on Linux, so asking
us to endorse anything else for signing is going to require some convincing on
your part.

Here's the template:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What organization or people are asking to have this signed:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rohde & Schwarz Cybersecurity GmbH

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What product or service is this for:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trusted Disk full-disk encryption

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trusted Disk provides full-disk encryption for internal and external storage devices and protects data from unauthorized access. With a signed SHIM bootloader we are able to use the secure boot feature to ensure that each of the files in the boot chain are unmodified.

Please create your shim binaries starting with the 15.4 shim release tar file:
https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/download/15.4/shim-15.4.tar.bz2

This matches https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/15.4 and contains
the appropriate gnu-efi source.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are using https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/download/15.4/shim-15.4.tar.bz2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URL for a repo that contains the exact code which was built to get this binary:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please use the Dockerfile in https://github.com/Rohde-Schwarz/shim-review/tree/rohdeschwarz-shim-x64-20210401 to build and verify our shim bootloader. We are using https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/download/15.4/shim-15.4.tar.bz2 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What patches are being applied and why:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**msabi.patch** Using the ms_abi calling convention for the SHIM_LOCK protocol function invocation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If bootloader, shim loading is, GRUB2: is CVE-2020-14372, CVE-2020-25632,
 CVE-2020-25647, CVE-2020-27749, CVE-2020-27779, CVE-2021-20225, CVE-2021-20233,
 CVE-2020-10713, CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311,
 CVE-2020-15705, and if you are shipping the shim_lock module CVE-2021-3418
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No GRUB bootloader is used.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What exact implementation of Secureboot in GRUB2 ( if this is your bootloader ) you have ?
* Upstream GRUB2 shim_lock verifier or * Downstream RHEL/Fedora/Debian/Canonical like implementation ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No GRUB bootloader is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If bootloader, shim loading is, GRUB2, and previous shims were trusting affected
by CVE-2020-14372, CVE-2020-25632, CVE-2020-25647, CVE-2020-27749,
  CVE-2020-27779, CVE-2021-20225, CVE-2021-20233, CVE-2020-10713,
  CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311, CVE-2020-15705,
  and if you were shipping the shim_lock module CVE-2021-3418
  ( July 2020 grub2 CVE list + March 2021 grub2 CVE list )
  grub2:
* were old shims hashes provided to Microsoft for verification
  and to be added to future DBX update ?
* Does your new chain of trust disallow booting old, affected by CVE-2020-14372,
  CVE-2020-25632, CVE-2020-25647, CVE-2020-27749,
  CVE-2020-27779, CVE-2021-20225, CVE-2021-20233, CVE-2020-10713,
  CVE-2020-14308, CVE-2020-14309, CVE-2020-14310, CVE-2020-14311, CVE-2020-15705,
  and if you were shipping the shim_lock module CVE-2021-3418
  ( July 2020 grub2 CVE list + March 2021 grub2 CVE list )
  grub2 builds ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No GRUB bootloader is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your boot chain of trust includes linux kernel, is
"efi: Restrict efivar_ssdt_load when the kernel is locked down"
upstream commit 1957a85b0032a81e6482ca4aab883643b8dae06e applied ?
Is "ACPI: configfs: Disallow loading ACPI tables when locked down"
upstream commit 75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354 applied ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No Linux kernel is used.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use vendor_db functionality of providing multiple certificates and/or
hashes please briefly describe your certificate setup. If there are allow-listed hashes
please provide exact binaries for which hashes are created via file sharing service,
available in public with anonymous access for verification
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No vendor_db is used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are re-using a previously used (CA) certificate, you will need
to add the hashes of the previous GRUB2 binaries to vendor_dbx in shim
in order to prevent GRUB2 from being able to chainload those older GRUB2
binaries. If you are changing to a new (CA) certificate, this does not
apply. Please describe your strategy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is our first SHIM submission.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What OS and toolchain must we use to reproduce this build?  Include where to find it, etc.  We're going to try to reproduce your build as close as possible to verify that it's really a build of the source tree you tell us it is, so these need to be fairly thorough. At the very least include the specific versions of gcc, binutils, and gnu-efi which were used, and where to find those binaries.
If possible, provide a Dockerfile that rebuilds the shim.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please use the included Dockerfile to build and verify our shim bootloader.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which files in this repo are the logs for your build?   This should include logs for creating the buildroots, applying patches, doing the build, creating the archives, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/Rohde-Schwarz/shim-review/blob/rohdeschwarz-shim-x64-20210401/build.log

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add any additional information you think we may need to validate this shim
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to an email from the Microsoft signing team, we submit our signing request to both the SHIM review board and through the Microsoft signing portal.
